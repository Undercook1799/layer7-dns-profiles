## Installation Guide

For **iOS**, seek a DNS provider from the list and click either HTTPS or TLS using Safari and click Install when given a prompt that states "XXXX." The profile will now install. Go to Settings and click on "Profile Downloaded." Follow the instructions. Your DNS configuration will now be changed to the one that you've installed. To manage your DNS configuration, go to Settings => General => VPN, DNS, and Device Management => DNS to change your DNS providers.

To remove DNS profiles from your device, go to Settings => click General => VPN, DNS, and Device Management => click on the profile that you've like to delete => click "Remove Profile."

For **macOS Big Sur & Monterey**, double click on the downloaded file and approve instalation in System Preferences => Security & Privacy => Profiles

For **macOS Ventura**, double click on the downloaded file and approve instalation in System settings => Privacy & Security => Profiles.

## Problems with DNS Profile?

Yeaaaaah. There may be problems with the DNS configuration or the DNS resolver itself or a user error. Open up an issue request and I or others will take a look.

## Contributing a new profile

Profiles are basically text files. Copy the template and change the things with @@@@Adguard@@@@ (recommend by via "replace all"), IP addresses, and be sure to change its UUID, for example, by generating a new one ["online (V4)"](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/). Make sure you update the README with the new profile's info. Or you can create an "issue" in this repository with the link to the DNS provider that you would like to be added.

Check out Apple's documentation for DNS: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement/dnssettings/ or [Here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement/dnssettings/)

Table format is | DNSNAME | Filtered? (Yah/Nah) | source link | Anycast? (Yah/Nah) | [HTTPS](httpslink), [TLS](tlslink) |

- source link = https://github.com/Undercook1799/layer7-dns-profiles/raw/master/profiles/WHATEVER-PROFILE-NAME-HERE.mobileconfig

#### Notes:

- This was forked from Paul Miller's repo: https://github.com/paulmillr/encrypted-dns
- DoH ("DNS over HTTPS) will run your queries over port 443; DoT ("DNS over TLS") will run your queries over port 853. Note that DNS runs over port 53 by default.
- None of these profiles are signed xoxo
- Not going to lie, but I have minimal idea of how to operate Github
- Profiles with a strikethrough in the name are not working properly

#### Disclaimer:

- I don't operate any of the DNS servers within these profiles. If there are any issues with the resolvers, it may not be my fault. Pretty much anything after the installation process of the profile is not on me. I am not liable if something goes wrong or for any illegal activities.
